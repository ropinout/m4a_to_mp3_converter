# mp3_to_wav_converter
a very basic and small project for convert mp3 files to wav
(just put it in your music folders)
```python
import os
import soundfile as sf

main_folder = os.listdir()
for file_name in main_folder:
    if file_name.endswith('.mp3'):
        data, samplerate = sf.read(file_name)
        sf.write(file_name[:-4] + ".wav", data, samplerate, format='WAV')
    else:
        print(file_name, "is not mp3, so i cant convert")
```
If you have any suggestionsØŒ it would make me happy if you told me.
